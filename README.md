## DataScience_Nanodegree_p1-Seattle_Airbnb

## Intro
This repository refers to the first project of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree in which we explore the Seattle housing market by looking into the available Airbnb-Data of [this Kaggle-competition](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data)

## What's in here?
In this repo you'll find a jupyter notebook in which you can see all the datawrangling and plots described in this blog-post. 

## Install
To run the notebook you pretty much just need a standard Anaconda-installment. The data is not included in this repo, so you have to download it directly to the repo-folder in order to make the notebook work.

## Questions asked
The three main questions I wanted to answer with this dataset are the following.

 - Whats the cheapest time of the year to travel to Seattle and how does it match with the booking volume?
 - What are the most expensive / cheapest neighbourhoods?
 - Is the host behaviour influencing the price?
